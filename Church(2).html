          <h2>CCS Opening Devotion</h2>
          <p>On August 19, 2024, the CCS Opening Devotion was held at Silliman University Church at approximately 8:00 AM on August 19, 2024. The devotion is the official opening of the Hibalag Festival which is one of the most important events in the university. The faculty, staff, and many others chose to attend including my friends and we were all seated in the SU church. As always, the speaker preached the usual message of persistence and faith that we will have in the days to come.</p> <br>
          <p>Afterwards, it was the usual anyone who attended a church service would expect — the opening prayer and the readings from from the scripture by the speaker. She shared the wisdom, perseverance and faith themes, with inspirational messages connecting with each student, and encouraged us to face challenges with integrity and resilience. Finally, students went out as a collective, which is why it was a community building moment, and the program ended with a blessing ceremony. I felt that the whole process taught me the importance of joining faith with community in life and everyone who recognizes those values inside: The will to hang in there, the will to have faith, that you have, even when things get tough, even when people think you haven't got what it takes.</p> <br>
          <p>With any luck, I’ll be able to use what I learned about myself here and have a little more self-awareness in my personal life to come as a result. Such experiences helped develop me closer to the community and helped share mine and others' inspiration from such events. Needless to say, this is a lesson to stay grounded in faith and Community support in the midst of this year’s challenges. It helped me determine what I wanted to achieve and how I can achieve that in the future. It was powerful moment of pause which in turn renewed my focus and will to begin the year on purpose and with resilience. This is also a formal opening of the Hibalag Festival, one of the very important events of the university.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
          <h2>Sunday Mass</h2>
          <p>On October 20, 2024, I attended the 8:30 AM Sunday Mass at San Antonio De Padua Church. For a christian, a sunday mass is something hugely important as it is not just our gateway to God, it also provides us a community which is full of faith and christian worship. That day it was a calm and peace morning, perfect for a church service. As soon as I entered, I heard the wave of serene comfort I always feel when inside a church. As the light would just shine right through it, it was just beautiful really, the church itself. </p> <br>
          <p> The most striking to me was the priest's message about faith in general just life. He touched on gratitude and how it's something we should strive to have in our every day lives — no matter how bad things feel. Granted, this is relatable for everyone except every man, woman, or child but that's what hit me as funny. He didn't oversell it and instead used simple everyday stories to make his point. I saw it made me realise how I often take some of the little things, like taking the time to do something kind, or just spending time with the people I love, so for granted. His words stuck in my head all day long. </p> <br>
          <p>The prayer intentions were another deeply meaningful part of the Mass. Listening to the prayers reminded me that everyone is dealing with something even if they don’t show it. It began to create this sense of connection, feeling the hardships and struggles of those around me. When it came time for Communion, everyone got up to take their piece of the holy bread. That may just have been the most important of the mass as it symbolizes us accepting Christ and his blessing for us</p> <br>
		  <p>As I walked out of the church after Mass, I felt lighter and more at peace. It wasn’t a big, life-changing moment, but it reminded me why going to Mass matters. It’s a chance to slow down, reflect, and feel connected—to God, to others, and to myself. I’m really glad I made the time to go, and I’m looking forward to going back again.</p> <br>

          <h2>Worship Culmination</h2>
          <p>On November 27, 2024, the Worship Culmination was held in the Amphitheater in front of the SU Church which a cozy and comfy atmosphere for all that attended. It was a great way to cap UCLEM with everyone eventually going home, reflecting and celebrating. I was there, part of the crowd, ready to partake in the event like with everybody else. It wasn’t fancy, it wasn’t over the top, it just had this sort of calm – and meaningful – feel to it that seemed right. </p> <br>
          <p>This had all wound so perfectly in this evening. During the night we sang some popular hymns, listened to scripture passages and prayed. However, the bit I found most memorable were the testimonies. Some listeners added their own anecdotes of how they linked their faith to thinking about times of difficulty or even miracles. It wasn’t cheesy or dramatic, it was just honest and real. And somehow, it hit me. In doing so, it made me reflect on the little good things in my life that I don’t necessarily give half the credit to.  </p> <br>
          <p>Then there was this simple moment that just clicked for me: the Christmas lights on the trees flicked on. Or it wasn’t a big production but it made the space feel warm and festive. It was a little reminder that Christmas is right around the corner and it gave off this perfect Christmas cozy vibe for the night.</p> <br>
		  <p>I was genuinely glad I’d been there when I left. It wasn’t some huge, massively life changing experience, but it was one of those evenings where you stop and take notice, and breathe and remind yourself of what’s good and what’s near, connect with you and connect with God and be present. And I hope those moments continue to happen, and that I can take the peaceful and connected feeling with me into whatever’s next.</p> <br>

          <h2>Midweek Prayer Service</h2>
          <p>On October 23, 2024 at 6 P.M, I attended the Midweek Service in Silliman University Church. The Department of Science and Technology Scholars' Association organized it and the purpose was to get students together and think reflect, relax, and reconnect with our faith, the thing I most needed mid week. </p> <br>
          <p>The service itself was quite nice. The group prayed, we all sang hymns, and we heard the sermons. The church's relaxed atmosphere where the lighting was soft, the sound of the organ and everything in between made it very easy to reflect, but what stood out for me was the spirit of solidarity each of those present share and else in between. We spent the rest of the time sharing about all the things we were doing despite the chaos to actually rest and refresh.  </p> <br>
          <p>From there, the entire event was a reminder of its own value in the idea of taking things one at a time, of scheduling time for introspection and faith. Balance is key because it’s very easy to get pulled off course in the craziness of life and I want to be able to be able to keep that up for a while now, I know that the power of prayer will help me stay grounded. </p> <br>
		  <p>All in all, I walked away from this service feeling refreshed and resolved, in a way, to pray and reflect, as much as possible. The fact that such a brief time in taking a break could be so spiritually beneficial can be seen.</p> <br>

          <h2>Night Of Worship</h2>
          <p>On November 1, 2024, around 5:00 pm, I attended METRO Church’s Night of Worship at the Pantawan park in Dumaguete City. The spirit behind all this was about gathering to have fun, worship and pray with one another. So as a participant, I took part in the worship activities, heard the messages and celebrated with the rest of the crowd. The church was run by a worship team who led services with great energy while volunteers set up and welcomed attendees. </p> <br>
          <p> We sang contemporary worship songs, read scripture, and prayed as we were led. The music was positive and awesome, and everything from being raised to the music and prayer in scripture flowed together and made for a very impactful night. My favorite part was once everyone's voice came together in the singing, I could actually feel the love and the faith making it all stronger than any time I had been seated by myself. It brought to my mind how powerful it is to pause to link with God and others. </p> <br>
          <p>The experience taught me the value of communal worship in giving one faith and sense of being to another. Attending these events is the perfect way to meet people who have the same goals as you have and want to live with a bit of spirituality in their life. </p> <br>
		  <p>Taking all of this into account, this Night of Worship made me determined to incorporate prayer and introspection into my daily life, and to remember that the value of continuing to belong to a community which values faith so highly as anything else.</p> <br>

It was equally funny and just a little unsettling because everyone got to know each other and share a personal phobia. We took turns placing our hands in a mystery box not knowing what you would find in there bu then again, it’s one of those things that when you look back on it, it was probably just a hairnet. Everything worked the way we had expected it to especially with how friendly the organizers were to everyone and making sure no one was left out. </p> <br>
          <p> One of the best moments of the night was the roleplay of David(LAB YOU JAV) and Goliath. For the skit, Goliath was being played by Rain and Josh who were carrying Craig Estrada and it had everyone laughing. But behind the humor, it was a powerful reminder of how faith can give strength to anyone no matter their size. After the skit, we paired up to pray for each other. My prayer partner was Kenydee Garcia and it felt really meaningful to pray for his health, safety and to thank God for all our blessings. </p> <br>
          <p>For this fellowship, I was more grateful and I was reminded that faith is strong. But it also taught me how beautiful it can be to be apart of a community that will help you when you need it. If I could do it all over again I would spend more time to connect with others. Of this event, I am more inclined to trust in God and anticipate the following days with everyone of my friends with the other believers. </p> <br>

          <h2>Stewards of God’s Grace</h2>
          <p>On December 7, 2024, at 5:00 PM, I was at a church service at the Silliman University Church in Dumaguete City. We primarily wanted to celebrate the advent season, by celebrating the themes of hope, peace, joy and love as we await the coming of Christ. I participated in playing my role included the worship activities of singing and prayer. The Pastoral team led a church service with the logistics and welcoming by those who helped. </p> <br>
          <p> At the service, we participated in prayers, read scripture, and sing classic and modern hymns which best supported the Advent themes. iIt  was most enjoying to hear the collective singing of the evening with all our voices blending together to the point where there seemed to be a strong sense of unity and shared faith amongst the congregation. This exercise reminded me all my values, especially the values of community, introspection, and the importance of finding time to work on your spiritual development. </p> <br>
          <p>The organisers added their warmth and creativity to make it an unforgettable event. We were encouraged to get out of our comfort zones and into the spotlight; to face our fears or to keep hold of hands in prayer. </p> <br>
		  <p>This fellowship also made me feel a whole lot more grateful and take notice of my faith more. But even that showed me how beautiful it was to be in a community of people that support each other. I take time to talk to that person, but if I could do it all again, I would have taken more time with everyone. This event made me motivated to trust God and look forward to moments like this with my friends and fellow believers.</p> <br>

          <h2>Aurora Of Mama Mary</h2>
          <p>I went to the "Aurora of Mama Mary" ceremony at San Antonio De Padua Church in Sibulan, Negros Oriental, on December 9, 2024, at 5:00 PM. It provided the crowd a calm and reflective gathering lasting about an hour and a half. This was mostly to build a closer relationship with the Virgin Mary in general and her involvement throughout the Advent season through the aid of prayer, hymns and meditations.  </p> <br>
          <p>During the event, we joined in with traditional hymns, prayed to in honor of the Virgin Mary. We prayed the Rosary and participated in guided prayers. The atmosphere within the church was beautiful especially when they placed the statue of Mama Mary so we could pray to her. The atmosphere of the church  produced a tranquil setting that was ideal for praying. This exercise reaffirmed by principles with devotion, introspection and its importance in scheduling time to spiritual development. </p> <br>
          <p>The experience has taught me how important group devotion can for creating that lost feeling of a sense of community. It reminded me that my personal well being relies on taking time to revive a sense of faith in spite of all other commitments. There will be times when I include in my schedule times for me to just sit and contemplate. They are such services that offers such a good environment for spiritual development and camaraderie that I have stayed with the church community. Doing these things provides one a sense of purpose and belonging, and a sense of the significance of the community to a persons spiritual growth. </p> <br>
		  <p>Through this event, I learned to understand how crucial in preserving spiritual health and embracing a sense of belonging it is to construct a time for regular times of Prayer and Meditation in my life.</p> <br>
