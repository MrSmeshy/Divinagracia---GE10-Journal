          <h2>Basketball Tournament</h2>
          <p>The FPBC organization decided to host a basketball tournament on December 8, 2024, at 8 AM in Daro Gym. Only two teams were up against each other, eager to outblaze one another with their skills. For them, this was not just a game of basketball; it constituted a game of skill and sportsmanship. This was a one-day tournament, but every match seemed to bring an exhilarating high through the next in line. However, being just a spectator, I felt that stirring within me to cheer my friends up, inciting them to try their very best.p> <br>
          <p>I will never grow tired of taking videos and pictures my closest friends' stumbling over the ball in an attempt to score, because that was surely my favorite moment. The star performer of the game, Jav Bucol, drew my interests and it was great watching him play. Everyone around seemed like they were part of something bigger, bonded with one another, fully in touch with their love for the game as well as the need to belong to a society that appreciates fun and teamwork. Best moment of the day was witnessing how, even though there was great competition, all came together in the end to laugh, congratulate, and then reflect on a day well spent.</p> <br>
          <p>The games reminded me of the importance of collaboration and teamwork. Everyone played at high speed, giving their absolute best. I was touched by how both teams never lost sight of their aim and kept encouraging one another through the tough times. It wasn't only about winning the point but to give it your all and have fun. Regardless of the result, it reminded us how much more we can achieve by persevering through problems in numbers.</p>

          <h2>Pasiklaban: Table Tennis"</h2>
          <p>I had the chance to attend the "Pasiklaban: Table Tennis" event hosted by the Silliman University Senior High School in October 2024. I saw students from various grade levels compete and display their table tennis skills. Such competitions enthralled audiences while creating an excitement-filled environment. I began to understand the giftedness necessary to play the game itself because of the pace and precision needed to be successful in it. </p> <br>
          <p> Enthusiasm was virtually palatable, as was the demeanour of really professional athletes towards one another it taught me the virtue of honest respect and fairness in sports. The event turned out to be a good reminder of the importance of community with sportsmanship. The talent of the athletes was evoked as well. </p> <br>
		  <p>All in all, the "Pasiklaban: Table Tennis" event was an enjoyable experience which left me with a greater appreciation for the sport and the effort to compete at a high level. As a spectator, I left feeling motivated to improve my own skills and to approach challenges with a more focused mindset.</p> <br>

          <h2>2024 Dumaguete Triathlon</h2>
          <p>I had the great pleasure of attending Dumaguete Triathlon in 2024 on the 10th of November, right at 5:00 PM at Pantawan People's Park on Rizal Boulevard. An annual triathlon comprising a long-distance swim of 1.5km, a biking leg of 40km, and a running leg of 10km saw the participation of competitors from various parts of the country and across the world. Observing from the sidelines, I was thrilled to see the commitment of the racers and the camaraderie of the community surrounding this most important occasion. </p> <br>
          <p>All the athletes were wondrously talented and sportsmanlike, with the electrifying atmosphere very motivating. To see the bikers ride the course, the runners pushing their limits, and the swimmers handle the open water close to the boulevard was an inspiring experience. Upon showcasing its athletes with immense physical presence, this event emphasized their inner strength and camaraderie. The reminder was striking on how much more involved the community is, as well as how much sporting events foster wellness and harmony. </p> <br>
          <p>I am always reminded of the motivation and hard work that would be put into such challenging competitions every time I reflect back upon the experience. The triathlon served as a reminder of the values of persistence, self-discipline, and community support. It inspired me to forge ahead concerning my own fitness goals and to take an active role in personal development activities that foster community spirit.</p> <br>
		  <p>I would like to summarize this far by saying that the Dumaguete Triathlon 2024 was the very embodiment of community spirit and human endurance. It left a deep impression upon me about the place of setting aims in life, going through challenges, and supporting one in one another's efforts.</p> <br>

          <h2>Dodgeball For A Cause</h2>
          <p>The event tuned into action on November 13, 2924, 3 PM at Ravello Field. The aim of the game was to hit other players with a ball, where I was a spectator, while others could have either been lead organizers or players. </p> <br>
          <p>An enjoyable experience for me was to observe different teams dodging the ball and I have to say that the sight of their determination to win and enjoy made it even better. What surprised me was how some players were so determined to win the game. For me, such qualities revealed inner excitement when the players tried their hardest. </p> <br>
          <p>I have not found this to be an inconvenience in any way and as to how I can keep in touch with this organization, I would try to keep in touch with their latest announcements that may be released on Facebook which include DOST SU. </p> <br>
		  <p>Because of this activity, I became more interested in watching sports</p>

          <h2>Roblox Carshow Competition</h2>
          <p>This event happened online via Roblox on December 15, 2024 as part of the Driving Empire game. The Sports Committee took the responsibility for this event and we were on a Discord call. We were all first years for CCS, and I was just another one of the many competitors in the game. </p> <br>
          <p>The essence of this event were the upgrades and the most perfect design of a car. We were judged on performance, style, innovation, and even noise levels while stationary by three members of a sports committee. In addition to a bit more knowledge on color harmony and matching colors, I did learn a bit more about shaping and working of the car.</p> <br>
          <p>Overall, this was a wonderful time with my classmates and the game added to the interest in sport vehicles. That was my first attempt at using a debit card, and it worked! This is a car game that was both fun and informative, as different types of cars and motorcycles were being introduced. If I had a choice, I would've bought one of the more expensive types of vehicles in the game, but it just seems like overkill. </p> <br>
		  <p>Because of this activity, I became more interested in the intricacies and complexities of sports cars.</p> <br>
