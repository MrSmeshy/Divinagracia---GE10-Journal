          <h2>Campus Tour</h2>
          <p>On September 18, 2024, from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM, I took part in a campus tour for Computer Science Department students at Silliman University. I had been one for two months and thought I would be taken through some familiar sites. To say it was revelatory, it introduced me to a new perspective of viewing the campus altogether.</p> <br>
          <p>For example, I learned that the orange doors of the College of Business Administration were actually emergency exits-a fact I had entirely overlooked before. I also stumbled upon the legend of Alice Fullerton's ghost, which supposedly appears every Founder's Day in Alice Fullerton Hall. Hearing these stories impressed on me Silliman is not merely a campus; it is a place with a long history-and character.</p> <br>
          <p>The tour didn't just highlight the history, the heritage, and the unique traditions of Silliman; I was made aware of 319 acacia trees, planted over the years as remembrance of historical feats, as it were, that all served to mark an important chapter in history at SU. Honestly speaking, it was quite a motivator standing in front of SU Hall, the oldest building on campus. Then there was this funny but strange little story about the Hibbard statue-it was said that taking a selfie there could "curse" you to not graduate. All that history, culture, and fun little quirks made for an unforgettable experience.</p> <br>
		   <p>By the end of this tour, I had gained a deeper understanding and connection with Silliman University. In my mind, I developed a new appreciation for its heritage, resilience, and traditions. To me, the experience lives out in the campus more, and I, on the other hand, feel inspired to dig deeper into the stories and cultures that make Silliman truly special. Grounded in this experience was a realization of the importance of not merely attending school but also of immersing oneself in what the institution has to offer.</p>

          <h2>Fitness Day Challenge</h2>
          <p> That morning, I was at ATA Hall from 7:30 AM to 8:30 AM for Day 1 of the Fitness Challenge. It was the event where CCS students get together for an upbeat and healthy Zumba session. I came there expecting a normal workout, but it turned out to be a surprisingly refreshing experience that was both a wake-up call and a confidence booster that changed my view on fitness. </p> <br>
          <p> At first, I figured it would have something to do with strength training or another workout-a bit like plyometrics-something I typically liked and would go for. So, I went surprised to know it was a Zumba class. But it did not take long for me to take it up. Even though I am not much of a dancer, it affected me so much that I chose to cut loose and simply enjoy myself. There was enough going to make me forget how tight I was at the end of a session-I was sweaty, smiling, and simply having a blast. </p> <br>
          <p>This experience was a gentle reminder to take it easy on myself. I realized that way back into physical activity via something small and enjoyable like Zumba was precisely what I needed instead of diving into hard work right away, I truly enjoyed a more relaxed way of remaining active. I even attended the second day of the challenge, and both days proved to be wonderful bonding opportunities with my fellow CCS Freshmen.</p> <br>
		  <p>Because of this, I realized the key was listening to my body and recovering instead of pushing myself so hard. It also taught me about fitness in general that it does not have to be about strict regimes or hitting specific targets. Sometimes, it's about having fun moving our bodies and socializing with others in a good environment. The Zumba lessons were instead a balance lesson on simply enjoying moving.</p> <br>

          <h2>Trivia Royale</h2>
          <p>When I think back to the "Trivia Royale" event held on August 21, 2024 at 8:30 AM in the Silliman University's College of Computer Studies (CCS), I find myself at the meeting point of mental stimulation and sociability. The event intended to elicit learned enlightenment on behalf of the competent participants in various domains while reflecting on a prominent erudition culture prevailing at CCS. </p> <br>
          <p>The activity of "Trivia Royale" has basically enhanced the spirit of teamwork and collaboration. It was teamwork between my fellow peers and myself because we worked together during the very difficult questioning, gaining mutual spirit and respect. This was a makeup of the collaborative working environment in which CCS guides us towards facing real-life situations demanding work with a team.  </p> <br>
          <p>In conclusion, Trivia Royale was not just another competition, but an opportunity to engage with the CCS community and exercise our knowledge in a stimulating environment. </p>

          <h2>Freshie Orientation</h2>
          <p>The CCS Freshmen Orientation kicked off on September 18, 2024, at 9 AM inside the cold confines of ATA Hall. The room was packed with freshmen like myself and heavy with the look of expectations. Our job was to get the means of existence—to learn the guidelines regarding the university, the do's and don'ts of the essentials, and the nitty-gritty stuff we would have to grasp on to shortly. I was there merely as a spectator, not knowing what to expect. Others who were in the same line of feeling were partaking in a test-watching, just like I was. </p> <br>
          <p>And here came the best part: I expected to be introduced to new friends; finally, I would be stepping beyond my comfort zone. However, what struck me was the massive gathering of people: students coming from various background and most who came from other schools. That place is big, awesomely overwhelming. Nothing about it really took the wind out of my sails, anyhow. I figured that meeting new friends was one thing that was literally standing out. And personally, that was gratifying.</p> <br>
          <p>But where do I stand now? Did it change my perspective of things in some way? Did it even rattle my views on life? Not really; but it did show me the simplicity of how social media, in particular Facebook, allows you to stay connected. Yes, I would ultimately meet them again on campus, face to face, but this experience somehow boosted my confidence in stepping out to connect. The unexpected boon? Set something off in me. Boosted my confidence; gave me the feeling that I could take a stand and connect. And honestly? I wouldn't do a single thing differently. </p> <br>
		  <p>In the end, this experience just gave me a nudge, the realization that the world is large, has so many that are willing to build connections like I am. It's not all about those large shifts or revolutionary moments. It is about those little moments of growth found in curious, unexpected places.</p> <br>

          <h2>Freshie Walk</h2>
          <p>A distinguishing event that day was the Freshie Walk on August 15, 2024, at the Luce Auditorium and the Amphitheater that welcomed the newcomers to Silliman University. School pastors serving as guest speakers, along with the confederates who helped organize and conduct the event, assisted freshmen from all colleges. </p> <br>
          <p>It was between interacting with fellow peers in school events that I really learned to hone in on my social skills; in fact, I made a buddy of the guy next to me. My perception changed completely from before. After being ushered into Luce Auditorium, I thought we would be marching around, screaming cheers, until we circled the school.  </p> <br>
          <p>The event helped me with improving my social skills and even made a new buddy of the fellow sitting next to me. I had a totally different outlook on the event from what I had originally thought about it. I thought we'd just march from the Luce Auditorium and yell on completing one full circle of the school. But I was pleasantly surprised when we sat down at the Amphitheater, where something more serious awaited us. Our school ministers gave us some motivational talks, and they gave us free notebooks, ballpoint pens, and gracious me, ice cream! The pastors emphasized the importance of believing in God and in ourselves. </p> <br>

          <h2>Parada Sillimania</h2>
          <p>The Parada Sillimaniana is an annual event celebrated on Silliman University's founders week, which I had the privilege to participate in on August 26, 2024, starting from 1 PM along with my fellow students. My expectations for this event were fairly accurate, as I expected it to be physically tiring but nonetheless an enjoyable experience. I did think it would be a little more taxing than what I had imagined. Luckily, the weather appeared kind that day. Upon our arrival at the destination, the Cimafranca ball field, we were to watch a dance performance by the different college departments, which I believe served as the highlight of the event.</p> <br>
          <p> One thing I will say was that I wished I could've participated in the parade rather than just witnessing although I was somewhat exhausted at that time. From where I was, it was nice to see all the departments and guests marching onwards. The other fun part was the sense of pride I had watching our department being represented. </p> <br>
          <p>Through this activity, I have learned how to be supportive of others and how to be in a community. Even though I was not able to support the parade physically, I learned I could still contribute by helping and cheering on my classmates. This sense of community spirit is what I plan to carry forward in future events. </p> <br>

          <h2>Entrep</h2>
          <p>This is an opportunity that came my way in November 2024, during the "Entrep" event at Silliman University organized by the CBA, where I was absolutely thrilled to learn about entrepreneurship from a student's view, demonstrate scope for creativity and innovation on the part of the student community in business, and witness the power of presenting their business ideas, products, and services. The venue was alive with the energy that one sensed as the participants presented their business ideas, products, and services, and I was thrilled to see how the students had mechanized what they had learned into reality. </p> <br>
          <p> I think the most rewarding aspect of the "Entrep" event was exposure to real-life business concepts. Watching the students put up their booths and display their food/products was magnificent. It showed me that entrepreneurship is not only about having a good idea, but more importantly, it is the conveyance of that idea in an appropriate way, strategic planning, and resilience in overcoming challenges. The event made me realize how important it was to build a network with other students, faculty, and industry experts, as collaboration and feedback can significantly improve any business idea. </p> <br>
          <p>Besides, this made me interested in learning about business and how I might take these ideas into my way of living. From the many ideas presented, it made me see that entrepreneurship can be done in different ways. </p> <br>
		  <p>Looking back at this event, I feel inspired and excited. It is a stark reminder that the world of business changes and presents opportunities, and the fateful first step is often the most important.</p> <br>

          <h2>Dal-Uy Festival</h2>
          <p>It was a privilege for me to be present during the festival of Dal-Uy hosted by Foundation University at Dumaguete City in the evening hours of August 31, 2024. Being called the "Festival of Hope," the festival is one of those cherished annual occasions when the university family gathers together to celebrate unity and shared aspirations. This practice, which corresponds to the floating of lanterns in Japanese tradition on water, represents heartfelt wishes and prayers symbolizing hope.  </p> <br>
          <p>On my arrival at the waterfront along Rizal Boulevard, I still could not get over how beautiful it was. There were thousands of lanterns, handmade with careful attention to detail and brightly lit as they floated on the surface of the sea, each carrying some meaningful messages. You could feel the energy and talent of students, teachers, staff, and alumni working hand in hand to help create this very special evening. The fireworks display surprisingly lit up the night sky, eliciting oohs and ahhs, which contributed to the moment being more magical. </p> <br>
          <p>It was highly significant for me to take part in this years Dal-Uy Festival. I felt connected, with myself, the university community, and shared dreams whenever I released my lantern to the waters. With every flicker of the lantern fading out of my sight, carrying my hopes with it, was a truly emotive reaffirmation of the dreams that unite us and the strength we get in being together. </p> <br>
		  <p>Reflecting on the event, I am really grateful to be part of such a lively and supportive community. The Dal-Uy Festival was not about simple, individual wishes; rather it was about celebrating the spirit of oneness that binds us all in the struggle for a better future ahead of all. This has revived my own gratitude for tradition, unity, and the small but heavy act of sharing hope.</p> <br>
