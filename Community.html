          <h2>Coastal Cleanup</h2>
          <p>The coastal cleanup attempted to raise pollution awareness and get the community involved in coastal ecosystem maintenance activities in Dumaguete on September 29, 2024, starting at 5:00 AM with volunteers gathering in the early morning hours to clean the beach in fostering community spirit and shared responsibility for the community.</p> <br>
          <p>I, Aldrich, and some others went for a road cleanup. I was aghast to see how much trash had been carelessly thrown by people. The coastal cleanup opened my eyes to the mind-boggling environment damage that trash can do. Despite its unpleasantness, I had a feeling of accomplishment in being part of the cleanup. It deepened my connection with the environment and the community in general.</p> <br>
          <p>Looking back at it now, it's super essential to prepare oneself for protecting the ecosystem. The whole cleanup elucidated on the importance of waste-handling with reverence and adopting sustainable techniques. The importance of community participation in combating environmental challenges was also underscored. I plan to tune in my life more on sustainable practices so I can live more and do my part in helping to clean the planet and keep joining environmental events.</p> <br>
		  <p>Because of this activity, the coastal cleanup event turned out to be a real eye-opener in equipping me with regards to practicing environmental preservation and the power of working together. It re-politicized my idea about how to care for natural resources and enhance my passion to be environmentally responsible.</p>

          <h2>Food Program</h2>
          <p> On November 12, 2024, I joined an FPBC organization to start a food program as one of the projects aimed at supporting the elementary pupils at the Sibulan Central Elementary School. This is a selfless venture designed with a motive to feed them and cater for the nutritional needs of the students in order that they get enough nutrients to nourish their minds and bodies for learning and development. The Program was initiated to provide nutritious meals during school hours in an environment contributing to the overall achievement of both academic and personal growth.</p> <br>
          <p> This experience clearly demonstrated the importance of a community coming together for social betterment. The fact that I saw students concentrating better and willing to participate in class because of food gives me great satisfaction. But more importantly, this program on an even deeper level further validated all my beliefs around collective and positive change; groups like FPBC are vital players in the development of a community. </p> <br>
          <p>Because of this activity, it has taught me not to stop contributing to the projects addressing and developing children's welfare and their ongoing education. Witnessing the success of the food program at Sibulan Central Elementary School gives me further motivation to continue helping people in the community so that no child misses an opportunity to gain what he or she deserves-his or her education being the first.</p>

          <h2>Donation Drive For Bata Ng Calabnugan</h2>
          <p>On December 4, 2024, I came along and joined the donation drive organized for the benefit of Bata ng Calabnugan, a local organization protecting orphaned and at-risk girls within a caring shelter in Sibulan and Dumaguete City, toward making them productive in their respective communities. I donated 100 pesos to support their ongoing needs. </p> <br>
          <p>The Bata Ng Calabnugan gives shelter, education, and healthcare to school children with no hope. I was left with a soul-gladdening fulfillment that, through donation, I would be able to help these kids have the services and aids they need to build a sustainable, better future.  </p> <br>
          <p>The experience reminded me that community-based initiatives are powerful enough to change individual lives and society and this renewed my belief in cooperative action and the importance of standing up for organizations that work tirelessly to uplift marginalized groups. I felt inspired to actively seek out and take part in more community-building opportunities considering that even the smallest acts can turn a life around. </p> <br>

          <p> Reflecting on the "Pep Community Outreach" event at Silliman University on November 17, 2024 at 4:00 PM, I was filled with a profound sense of gratitude and inspiration. </p> <br>
          <p>The primary aim of "Pep Community Outreach" is to primarily involve students to give food to the janitors and other faculty in an attempt to address their needs . This initiative synchronizes with Silliman University's mission of "instilling in all members of the University community an enlightened social consciousness and a deep sense of justice and compassion."</p> <br>
          <p>The "Pep Community Outreach" event was an example of Silliman University's commitment to the community and service learning. It fostered collaboration among students towards knowledge and engagement that would yield a benefit to the community. I appreciate having been involved in this wonderful initiative and look forward to future ventures that advocate for social responsibility and community upliftment. </p>

          <p>On December 14, 2024, our GE10 class had a program called "White Gift Giving" at the Sto. Niño Orphanage in Dumaguete City, starting at 12:00 PM. The program was designed to donate essential items and heartfelt Christmas cards to the orphanage. It sought to create a sense of community coupled with compassion. </p> <br>
          <p>We started by gathering any recyclable materials to make homemade Christmas cards and gift wraps. People on the team contributed sanitary napkins, shampoo, soap, sardines, adult diapers, toothpaste, noodles, canned goods, milk, and Milo. We used the class time to design cards and gift wraps such that every specific gift would be painstakingly wrapped for crphans. </p> <br>
          <p>This experience compelled me to reaffirm my commitment to the importance of community service and the alumni program's simple yet profound joy of giving. Such reiterations also gave me the thought that even small gestures create immense happiness and change someone else's life in a moment. I am inspired to keep doing such initiatives and spur others to do the same: that of establishing a caring culture.. </p> <br>
